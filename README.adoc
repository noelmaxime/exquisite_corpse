Once upon a time a person named Git. Git had a lot of problems 
in his life because of the difficulty for people to understand him and to speak with him.
People prefered GitHub, his brother.
But few people liked him, and knew how powerful he is. People begin to understand him and became very popular. Without git no one could live peacefully.
